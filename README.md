<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![](https://github.com/yangle15/RANet-pytorch/imgs/RANet_overview.png)

Existing adaptive inference researches mainly exploit the architecture redundancy of deep models from the perspective of network depth or width. In this project, we focus on the spatial redundancy of images and propose a Resolution Adaptive Network (RANet), which is inspired by the intuition that low-resolution representations are sufficient for classifying easy samples containing large objects with prototypical features, while only some hard samples need spatially detailed information. In a RANet, the input images are first routed to an efficient sub-network that only extracts low-resolution feature representations, and those with high prediction confidence will exit early from the network without being further processed. Meanwhile, the high-resolution paths in the network maintain the capability to correctly classify the hard samples. Therefore, RANet can effectively reduce the spatial redundancy involved in inferring high-resolution inputs.
